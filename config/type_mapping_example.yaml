# Example configuration showing primitive type mapping to IDL types
#
# This configuration demonstrates how to map EA model types to proper IDL types.
# The primitive_types field is a dictionary where:
#   - Keys: Type names as they appear in Enterprise Architect
#   - Values: IDL type names to output in generated IDL
#
# By default, the tool provides CORBA IDL-compliant mappings, but you can
# customize them here if your EA model uses different type names.

# Primitive type mappings
primitive_types:
  # Standard IDL types (identity mapping)
  "short": "short"
  "unsigned short": "unsigned short"
  "long": "long"
  "unsigned long": "unsigned long"
  "long long": "long long"
  "unsigned long long": "unsigned long long"
  "float": "float"
  "double": "double"
  "long double": "long double"
  "char": "char"
  "wchar": "wchar"
  "boolean": "boolean"
  "octet": "octet"
  "string": "string"
  "wstring": "wstring"

  # Common aliases (mapped to IDL equivalents)
  "int": "long"              # int is not valid IDL, map to long (32-bit)
  "unsigned int": "unsigned long"

  # Custom mappings - add your own here
  # Example: if your EA model uses "int32" or "uint32", map them:
  # "int32": "long"
  # "uint32": "unsigned long"
  # "int64": "long long"
  # "uint64": "unsigned long long"
  # "text": "string"
  # "bool": "boolean"

# If a type appears in your model that is NOT in this mapping and has no
# connector (relationship), the tool will FAIL with a clear error message
# telling you to add it to the primitive_types mapping.
